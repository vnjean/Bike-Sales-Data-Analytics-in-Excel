# Bike Sales Data Cleaning and Dashboard Creation in Excel

### Overview:

This project involves the data cleaning process and dashboard creation for bike sales data in Excel. The dataset includes columns such as ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, and Purchased Bike.

### Data Cleaning Steps:

1. **Remove Duplicates:**
   - Eliminated 26 duplicates using the "Remove Duplicates" tool in Excel.

2. **Standardize Values:**
   - Changed 'M' to 'Married' and 'S' to 'Single' in the Marital Status column.
   - Changed 'F' to 'Female' and 'M' to 'Male' in the Gender column using Find and Replace.

3. **Age Brackets:**
   - Created a new column for age brackets using IF statements: 
     - Less than 31 is 'Adolescent', 31 to 54 is 'Middle Age', and greater than 54 is 'Old'.

### Cleaned Data:

The dataset was meticulously cleaned, including standardizing values and creating meaningful age brackets.

### Pivot Tables:

Utilized pivot tables to generate insights:

1. **Average Income by Gender:**
   - Revealed average incomes for males and females.

2. **Bike Purchase Counts:**
   - Displayed counts of bike purchases based on commute distance and age brackets.

3. **Bike Purchase Distribution:**
   - Showed the distribution of bike purchases across different age groups.

### Dashboard:

A comprehensive dashboard was created based on pivot tables to provide an intuitive visualization of the data.
